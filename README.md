# Pearson-Correlation-Co-efficient & Linear Regression

## 🌐 Technologies Used
* C Language

A basic data science project using C Language to calculate Pearson-Correlation Co-efficient and Linear Regression between variables that uses C concepts like: Structs, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Pointers, and so on. 

## 📌 Further Improvements
* Implmenting File Handling to the Code.
* Further polishing of the overall code structure, and adding a manual input bias.
* Implementing Visual Plotting to a CSV File using GNUPlot.
