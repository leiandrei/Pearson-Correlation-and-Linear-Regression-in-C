# Pearson Correlation and Linear Regression in C

## Technologies Used:
- 🌐 C Language

This is a **C-Based Language** Pearson Correlation Co-efficient Analyser and Linear Regresion Model made from scratch using C concepts such as: Dynamic Structs and Arrays, Functions, and such. It performs both inferential statistics and analysis using Pearson Correlation and Linear Regression.

## Pearson Correlation Co-efficient Formula
This is the Pearson Correlation Co-efficient formula that was used for this model.

## Linear Regression Formula
This is the Linear Regression formula for this model. The regression model uses an OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression Analysis. This analysis aims to create a linear equation to describe relationships between variables.
